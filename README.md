# flop-swap-desk

A non-custodial atomic swap desk for FLOP: trade FLOP against another chain's asset with two
hash time-locked escrows, one shared secret, and no one in the middle holding anything.

- **Profile** (`docs/PROFILE.md`): how two ordinary [`tclk/1`](https://github.com/flop-labs/tclk)
  contracts declare themselves the legs of one swap using only the signed `offer.job` field.
  No new frame types, no wire change; any tclk/1 client can speak it.
- **Board + watcher** (`src/board.ts`, `src/watcher.ts`, `bin/watch.mjs`): a read-only fold of
  the `tclk-offers` room and each swap's derived deal room, using tclk's own fail-closed
  `foldTranscript`, that pairs legs, derives a composite swap state, and keeps a byte-exact
  audit trail. It holds no keys and cannot post, lock, claim, or refund.
- **Deadline checker** (`src/deadlines.ts`): the timelock rules that make the two legs atomic,
  including yellow paper R10.2 timelock symmetry in the orientation this profile fixes.
- **Client** (not yet built): the party-side agent that holds *your* keys and drives the rails.

## Status

**Alpha, Phase 0, keyless.** Nothing here moves value. There is no FLOP testnet RPC yet; the
FLOP leg is bound through tclk PR #171's mock chain only. The only rail with a read path today
is tclk's `paper` rail (`vendor/tclk/src/paper-rail.ts`) — a rehearsal surface that holds no
value and whose records anyone can overwrite; the board can fold a fully-rehearsed swap all the
way to `settled` on paper evidence, but every reason trail it produces says so
(`"paper rail: rehearsal only, no value"`). Chain rails (`evm-htlc`, `flop-htlc`, …) still have
no read path, so a swap settling for real cannot advance past `paired` today — by design, not by
accident (fail closed). Every end-to-end atomicity claim remains PENDING until yellow paper open
item E.48 closes, and this repository does not present one.

## The one rule that makes it work

The **Seller of FLOP always holds the secret**. It accepts the Buyer's counter-asset leg (leg A)
and mints the hash statement; it opens the FLOP leg (leg B) whose acceptor copies the same
statement. Leg B is always the long timelock. That single orientation satisfies R10.2 as the
yellow paper wrote it and tclk/1's acceptor-mints-statement rule at the same time. Bids are
therefore Buyer-initiated in v1; a Seller advertises with the DID-note token `swap1:sell-flop`
and waits for a bid.

## Build and test

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

`@flop-labs/tclk` is vendored as a git submodule (`vendor/tclk`) pinned to upstream `main`
commit `5cc4ab9`, because the npm release `0.1.0` predates the transcript fold this desk
depends on. `npm test` builds it first. Clone with `--recurse-submodules`.

## Audit replay

`examples/audit-export.mjs --root DIR [--expect <swapId>=<status>] [--json]` reproduces a
watch root's board — every swap's status, reasons, buyer/seller DIDs, the offer-room and
deal-room seqs it was derived from, and each paper note's `finalizedRef` — purely from what
`src/watcher.ts` already wrote to `DIR/raw/`. It opens no network connection: the offer-room
export(s), each deal room's capture(s), and any paper-rail note(s) are read straight off disk
and folded through the same `foldCaptured` (`src/replay.ts`) the live watcher uses, so a
capture can be re-verified without trusting the process that produced it.

`fixtures/rehearsal-2026-09-18/` is a byte-exact, watch-root-shaped capture of the real
2026-09-18 G0 rehearsal on `paper` — the four `tclk-offers` lines that made the pair, both
deal rooms' lock/reveal/receipt, and both paper notes fetched once, live, with curl. Run it:

```bash
node examples/audit-export.mjs --root fixtures/rehearsal-2026-09-18 \
  --expect 0xb0fa70a3c2a914134967fa423ae3295c2e35b6c3dfd6d461fb7a17fef2430d46=settled
```

## What this is not

No AMM, no pool, no fee, no custody, no relayer (yellow paper R10.4's allowlisted relayer is
not used: each party redeems its own leg), no point/adaptor locks (tclk's adaptor path is
unaudited reference crypto), no mainnet value.
